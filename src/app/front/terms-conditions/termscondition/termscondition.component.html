                               29 Member does not have to furnish the information required for registration to portal. However, without that information Member will not be able to use the services of portal. William John and Co. is the sole owner of the information collected on this Site. portal will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this Agreement.  <br>
                               30 In order to use portal, both Members and Experts must first complete a registration form. During registration the Member is requested to furnish contact information, such as name and email address. This information may be used to contact the Member about the services on portal in which he or she has expressed interest, and is also used as Member's login information. Member may be asked to provide additional personalized information (such as experience and qualifications, areas of interest, profession, education, etc.) and unique identifiers (such as a screen name), so portal may provide a more personalized experience on the Site. In such case the Member may decide whether he or she wishes to provide such information or not.  <br>
                               31 The information furnished by the Member during the registration process will be kept in portal's database. portal will use reasonable means to protect the integrity and safety of the database. However, such means are not fault-proof and portal will therefore not be liable for any direct, indirect, consequential or incidental damage that the Member may sustain due to unauthorized intrusion of the database.  <br>
                               32 The main purpose of portal is to allow the Member to look for Experts that may give the Member advice or a service that he or she seeks. portal does not screen or edit the content of communications between Experts and Members, but portal may copy, transmit and review communications conducted by or through portal for technical support and/or in order to uphold these Terms of Service. Such communications are personal and private unless both parties agree to additional distribution, for example by posting questions or services on the Public Board (described later). Currently, chat communications between the Member and portal's servers are encrypted. Chat communications between the Expert and portal's servers are also encrypted. Email and phone communications are not encrypted and thus may be more susceptible to unauthorized monitoring.  <br>
                               33 portal makes public bulletin boards available to its Members. The public boards allow Members to post questions or service requests that can be viewed by all Experts. Requests may be posted anonymously. A Member can also determine the length of time he or she wishes to have his or her question remain "in view" on the public board. All postings, descriptions, etc. are public until Member enters into a personal negotiation with an Expert. All subsequent communications between the Member and Expert, including both the negotiation phase and the actual relaying of service, are not available to other portal Members and Experts, and are confidential between Expert and Member. Chat and e-mail communications between Members and Experts are stored on portal servers for a certain amount of time and available for review by Experts and, if a paid session, by Members. portal uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track a Member's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are also linked to personally identifiable information in order to improve the Member's experience when using the Site. portal may also retain any emails, letters, or other correspondence between the Member and portal to ensure quality control and the best possible service, although it has no obligation to do so.  <br>
                               34 portal makes use of cookies to store information. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the Member's hard drive containing information about the Member. For instance, by accepting a cookie by portal, the Member will not have to enter his or her login information (his or her email and password) every time he or she logs into his or her account, thereby saving time while on portal. If the Member rejects the cookie, he or she may still use portal; Member will simply have to login each time he or she visits the Site. Cookies can also be used to enable portal to track and target the interests of the Member in order to enhance his or her experience on portal. Of course, if the Member shares his or her computer with others, others may be able, with certain browsers or under certain circumstances, to read the Member's communications with Experts and portal.  <br>
                               35 portal may use the information furnished by the Member, as well as information that it collects regarding use patterns and transactions that are conducted through portal, in order to improve portal, to analyze statistical information regarding portal, and to furnish such statistics to third parties, including advertisers. Information furnished to third parties will not identify the Member personally.  <br>
                               36 portal may from time to time send e-mail advertisements to Members, whether the material is its own or is commercial information furnished by third parties. Member is given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having his or her information used for purposes not directly related to portal at the point when portal asks for such information. portal's registration form has an 'opt-out' mechanism to allow for removal from newsletters, promotions, etc., and Members can always choose to 'opt-out' by following the appropriate procedure from within the Member's portal account.  <br>
                               37 Ratings and testimonials provided by Members on portal are public and are identified by the Member's Screen Name. If the Member elects to use portal's referral service for informing a friend about the Site, portal asks the Member for the friend's name and email address. portal will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the Site. portal stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact portal at care@psychicleaders.com to request the removal of this information from its database.  <br>
                               38 portal reserves the right to partner with another party to provide specific services. When the Member signs up for these services, portal will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services or as otherwise specified in the registration process for such services.  <br>
                               39 portal may assign, transfer, rent, sell or lease its database, without giving the Member any prior notice, to any other subsidiary of portal's holding company, portal's subsidiaries and, in any case of merger or bankruptcy to the surviving entity after such merger or bankruptcy or to any third party that will ratify portal's privacy policy. portal may divulge to a third party personally identifiable information and transaction details according to a judicial writ, demands of governmental authorities, and in any legal proceedings between portal and the Member. In addition, portal may disclose personally identifiable information to the Expert or to public authorities to deal with emergency situations or situations where the Member's safety may be in jeopardy.  <br>
                               40 portal may, in its discretion, create co-branded web sites with its partners. In such case the Member listings may appear in the co-branded site. Unless Member agrees otherwise, all personally identifiable information is stored solely by portal. portal does record an affiliate web site from which a visitor has linked to portal. If a visitor registers to become an Expert and/or a Member, portal may track the partner's name in order to further the relationships portal has with its affiliates.  <br>
                               41 If a Member wishes to update his or her personally identifiable information, such as a mailing address, or if a Member no longer desires portal's service, portal will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or opt-out of any of portal's services.
